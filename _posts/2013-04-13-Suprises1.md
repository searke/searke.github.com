# Suprises in Symbolic Computing - Complex Branch Cuts

-----

This is a category of posts I intend to revisit pretty often. The traps and pitfalls of symbolic methods are just as tricky, but recieve almost no attention from scientists and engineers.

For this post I would like to cover issues with multivalued functions. Most of these are inverse functions. Consider the square root function. We could say that \\(\sqrt{4}\\) is either 2 or -2. There are two "branchs" that we could choose here. By convention, we choose the positive branch. 

Inverse trigonometric functions are especially troublesome - they have many branchs to choose from. The Sine function is equal to zero for an infinitely many values.

$$ 0 = sin(0) = sin(\pi) = sin(2 \pi) ... $$

So \\(arcsin(0)\\) can be an infinite number of values. We choose one of these branchs by convention. When doing algebra, it is important to choose the correct value based on what we want \(arcsin\) to mean.

The correct choice of which branch to take is often just not even encoded in theequation. It's implicit - not explicit. Without this information, symbolic solvers have to choose a default branch cut to take. Even more frustrating, sometimesdifferent solvers don't even agree on which branch cut to take for a given value. 

## A Simple Differential Equation

-----

Consider this differential equation:

$$ \sqrt{f'(x)} = -x $$

We could solve it like this:

$$ f'(x) = x^2 $$

$$ f(x) = \frac{x^3}{3}+c $$

[This is exactly what a symbolic solver will do with this equation.](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=Sqrt%5Bf%27%5Bx%5D%5D+%3D%3D+-x)

This solution doesn't satisfy the original equation unless we note down that the square root is meant to take the negative branch. 

This is just one of the simplest examples of these problems. Typically, I see this issue with huge equations and tracking down the incorrect branch is a nightmare debugging problem.

## The Failure of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus

-----

This example is taken from [an excellent post in Wolfram Research's Blog](http://blog.wolfram.com/2011/11/08/mathematica-qa-series-surprises-in-differentiation-and-integration/). 

The fundamental theorem of calculus says that integration and differentiation are opposites and that they undo each other. However, consider this simple example using a logrithm below. Logrithms, like a lot of inverse functions, has branch cuts.

$$ \frac{\partial \log (-x)}{\partial x} = \frac{1}{x} $$

So if we integrate \\(1/x\\), we should get the original function, \\(\log(-x)\\), right? Nope.

$$ \int \frac{1}{x} \, dx = \log (x) $$

The functions \\(\log(x)\\) and \\(\log(-x)\\) aren't the same. Notice that we didn't need to use complex numbers anywhere to see this issue. It's commonly believed that branch cuts will never be an issue if you stay away from complex numbers. This isn't the case.  

When the fundamental theorem of calculus appears to fail in symbolic computing, branch cuts are almost always the cause. Fortunately, there is a good test to see if this is the case. Because branch cuts change the value of a function by adding a constant complex value, we should get a piecewise constant function when subtracting the expected result from the result we get back. This is a simple test to see if branch cuts are the culprit.
