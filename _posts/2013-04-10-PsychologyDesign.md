# Psychology as a Basis for User Interface Design

I just finished reading [Desgning with the Mind in Mind](http://www.amazon.com/Designing-Mind-Simple-Understanding-Interface/dp/012375030X). It's a great book on interface design and I've found it very helpful for highlighting user experience issues. 

There's a major issue with the organizing principal and main theme of the book however. The author assumes that good design depends on the application of cognitive psychology and that psychology substantiates good design. In particular, the author claims that cognitive psychology should guide the application of design principals in new contexts. None of this is obvious and there is good reason to be skeptical about it.

Soft sciences and pseudo-sciences alike love to claim that they are founded on hard sciences and respected research. It lends them credibility. You see this pattern in things like the technical analysis of stocks, which claims to be founded on rigorous statistics. You can see it in  economic models of incredible mathematical complexity as well.

These kinds of claims also provide a coherent mythology for origins of the field at the expense of ignoring real history. This book would have you believe that the field of design orginated as extension of biopsychological research. The mythology might provide a useful organization for exploring design, but it should be acknowledged as an incomplete truth at best.

We can trust the frameworks that underly many of the hard sciences because they make predictions or testable claims of some kind. As an example, Newton's laws predicted the existence of Neptune. Does cognitive pscyhology give us something similar? I haven't seen it. No principals of design in the book need the advances of cognitive psychology to explain their purpose or power. The most useful tool in discovering good design is empathy with the user.   

Some important topics in design don't fit the model in the book. Cognitive and biology pscyhology try to understand perception at the biological level. They study something universal to all humans. But many design principals depend heavily on culture. Cultural variance in design is outside of the model of design presented in the book.

The real scientific approach to design is the actually empirical approach - stuff like A/B testing. I don't see how many of the results from these experiements fit together with the story in the book.
