# Psychology as a Basis for User Interface Design

I just finished reading [Desgning with the Mind in Mind](http://www.amazon.com/Designing-Mind-Simple-Understanding-Interface/dp/012375030X). It's a great book on user interfaces and I've found it really helpful for not only communicating about user experience issues at work, but also for communicating how important these isues are. I am very thankful that the author wrote such a good introductory text.

I have one issue with the book - not a particular section, but instead the organizing principal of the book. The book assumes that design is an application of cognitive psychology and that psychology is the organizing principal behind the field. The author claims that, as the science underlying human perception, cognitive psychology should guide designers in applying design principals in new contexts and innovating design principals. None of this is obvious and there is good reason to be skeptical about it.

I do not deny the idea is powerful. It integrates design into a respected scientific discipline. Additionaly, the author says that many of the researchers to first articuate interface design principals had training in psychology. Neither of these facts are evidence that cognitive psychology and design are related to the degree the book claims. In fact, both of these are reasons that we should be more cautious about the claim. The field was founded by people with a bias towards a psychological description of human behavior and the field recieves validation by being connected to a science.

Frameworks in science are often verifiable because they make predictions or testable claims of some kind. Placing Newton's laws as the framework for planetary motion allowed us to discover Neptune. Does cognitive pscyhology have predictive powers in interface design? As far as I have seen, it doesn't have any power beyond what we would already have with a common knowledge of how humans think. A description of the region in the brain used for memory isn't helpful when you simply need to know that people have limited memory. I have found no principals of design in the book that need the advances of cognitive psychology to explain their purpose or power. Understanding them mostly requires an empathy and considersation for the users of your interfaces.   

Some aspects of interface design aren't mentioned in the book. These aspects even contradict the way in which design the text reduces design down into a science. Because cognitive pscyhology tries to break the mechanisms of perception down a biological level, it is inherently generalized and univeral to all humans. On the contrary, many of the principals of design can be heavily dependant on culture. Cultural variance in design wasn't covered in the book. It wouldn't have fit as a topic under the organizing principal of the text.

The most truly scientific approach to user interface design appears to be A/B testing. This is an actual empirical approach to the subject and I would be very hard pressed to explain many of the results found in A/B testing with cognitive psychology. A/B testing doen't provide a framework however. It's a testing method and not a theory. If a better one can be found than our common understanding of human perception, I'll have to wait.
