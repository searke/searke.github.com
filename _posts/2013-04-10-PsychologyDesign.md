# Psychology as a Basis for User Interface Design

I just finished reading [Desgning with the Mind in Mind](http://www.amazon.com/Designing-Mind-Simple-Understanding-Interface/dp/012375030X). It's a great book on interface design and I've found it very helpful for highlighting user experience issues. I am very thankful that the author wrote such a good introductory text.

There's one major issue with the book though. It's not a single section or chapter, but the organizing principal of the book. The book assumes that good design depends on the application of cognitive psychology and that psychology substantiates the field. In particular, the author claims that cognitive psychology should guide the application of design principals in new contexts. None of this is obvious and there is good reason to be skeptical about it.

Associating design with a science lends it credibility to the kind of people who are skeptical about its importance. But that's not a reason to believe that the association is real. Many other proffesions have sought to earn credibility in this way, like financial analysis did math. Just like the misapplication of math in finance, blindly applying psychology to design can ruin it.

We can trust the frameworks that underly many of the hard sciences because they make predictions or testable claims of some kind. As an example, Newton's laws predicted the existence of Neptune. Does cognitive pscyhology give us something similar? I haven't seen it. No principals of design in the book need the advances of cognitive psychology to explain their purpose or power. The most useful tool in discovering good design is empathy.   

Some important topics in design don't fit the model in the book. Cognitive and biology pscyhology try to understand perception at the biological level. They study something universal to all humans. But many design principals depend heavily on culture. Cultural variance in design is outside of the model of design substantiated by the science in the book.

The real scientific approach to design is the actually empirical approach - stuff like A/B testing. I don't see how many of the results from these experiements can be substaniated by the kind of science in the book.
