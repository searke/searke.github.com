# Hand Evolved Lindenmayer Systems

I was playing around with some [Lindenmayer Systems](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system) a while ago and decided that I should try to discover some new and interesting ones. This is harder than it sounds though. For the most part, it's not easy to hand code interesting Lindenmayer systems that aren't simple or a well known shape of some kind. So I hit upon the idea of evolving new systems under the evolutionary pressure of what I thought was pretty.

Each system starts off as a space filling curve. Random symbols are entered and deleted from the grammar of the space filling curve to create a new generation of curves. The most interesting of each generation are kept. This process is iterated many times until the newest generation of curves no longer resemble the original.
