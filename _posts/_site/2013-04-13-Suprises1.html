<hr />

<p>Symbolic methods have as many surprises and pitfalls as numerical methods. Unfortunately, this area receives less attention. I hope to cover several common mistakes in this blog.</p>

<p>The most common confusion I see is with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_branch">functions that have branches</a>. These are functions (often inverse functions) that could have multiple output values. As an example, consider the square root function. We could say that \(\sqrt{4}\) is either 2 or -2. There are two “branches” that we could choose here. We normally choose it to mean the positive branch (+2), but in some cases it may be helpful to interpret it as (-2). This is a serious ambiguity.</p>

<p>Inverse trigonometric functions are especially troublesome - they have many branchs to choose from. The Sine function is equal to zero for an infinitely many values.</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">0 = sin(0) = sin(\pi) = sin(2 \pi) ...</script>

<p>So, \(arcsin(0)\) can have an infinite number of values. We choose one of these “branches” by convention. When doing algebra, it is important to choose the correct value based on what we intend (arcsin) to mean. Most often this is just clear from context and human mathematicians don’t give it a second thought.</p>

<p>The correct choice of which branch to take is often just not even encoded in the equation. It’s implicit - not explicit. Without this information, symbolic solvers have to choose a branch cut to take. Even more frustrating, sometimes different solvers or books don’t even agree on which branch to take.</p>

<h2 id="a-basic-algebra-identity-that-doesnt-hold">A Basic Algebra Identity That Doesn’t Hold</h2>

<hr />

<p>Everyone knows how to use powers with fractions:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">(\frac{a}{b})^n = \frac{a^n}{b^n}</script>

<p>But this identity can fail, if we accidentally choose the wrong branch cut. Consider:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">(\frac{-1 + i}{ -1 - i}) ^{\frac{1}{3}}</script>

<p>Which evaluates to:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">0.866025 - 0.5i</script>

<p>And compare it with</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\frac{(-1 + i)^{\frac{1}{3}}}{( -1 - i)^{\frac{1}{3}}}</script>

<p>Which just gives:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">i</script>

<p>The difference is that different branch cuts have been taken. This is not obvious for most engineers and even many mathematicians.</p>

<h2 id="a-simple-differential-equation-gone-wrong">A Simple Differential Equation Gone Wrong</h2>

<hr />

<p>Consider this differential equation:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\sqrt{f'(x)} = -x</script>

<p>We could solve it like this:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">f'(x) = x^2</script>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">f(x) = \frac{x^3}{3}+c</script>

<p><a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=Sqrt%5Bf%27%5Bx%5D%5D+%3D%3D+-x">This is exactly what a symbolic solver will do with this equation.</a></p>

<p>This solution doesn’t satisfy the original equation unless we note down that the square root is meant to take the negative branch. Unfortunately, any solver is going to take positive branch instead.</p>

<p>This is just one of the simplest examples of these problems. With larger equations, tracking down the incorrect branch can become a nightmare.</p>

<h2 id="when-the-fundamental-theorem-of-calculus-fails">When the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus Fails</h2>

<hr />

<p>This example is taken from an <a href="http://blog.wolfram.com/2011/11/08/mathematica-qa-series-surprises-in-differentiation-and-integration/">excellent post in Wolfram Research’s Blog</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_theorem_of_calculus">fundamental theorem of calculus</a> very roughly says that integration and differentiation are opposites and should undo each other. However, consider the example using a logarithm below. Logarithms, like a lot of inverse functions, have branch cuts.</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\frac{\partial \log (-x)}{\partial x} = \frac{1}{x}</script>

<p>So if we integrate \(1/x\), we should get the original function, \(\log(-x)\), right? Nope.</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\int \frac{1}{x} \, dx = \log (x)</script>

<p>The functions \(\log(x)\) and \(\log(-x)\) aren’t the same. Notice that we didn’t need to use complex numbers anywhere to see this issue. It’s commonly believed that branch cuts will never be an issue if you stay away from complex numbers. This isn’t the case.</p>

<p>When the fundamental theorem of calculus appears to fail in symbolic computing, branch cuts are almost always the cause. Fortunately, there is a good test to see if this is the case. Because branch cuts change the value of a function by adding a constant complex value, we should get a <a href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=log%5B-x%5D-log%5Bx%5D">piecewise constant function when subtracting the expected result from the result we get back</a>. This is a simple test to see if branch cuts are the culprit.</p>
