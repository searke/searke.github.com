# Some Examples of the Method of Frobenius

## Motivation

## Overview

As a first step, assume that the function we wish to solve for, say \\(f\\), has the form:

$$ f(x) = \sum_{i=0}^{\infty} a(i)\,x^{i} $$

Here, \\(a(i)\\) is ith coefficient of the power series. We must define \\(a(i)\\) for each \\(i\\) so that f solves the equation.
