I"<h1 id="about-the-blog">About the Blog</h1>

<p>I’m using Jekyll as my static site generator and have switched from <a href="http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/">bootstrap</a> to <a href="http://purecss.io/">pure</a> for styling.</p>

<p>The blog is being hosted on GitHub. You can see what I’ve written in Jekyll on my profile.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.mathjax.org">MathJax</a> renders the mathematical formula on the blog posts.</p>

<p>The font for the blog is Arvo from Google Fonts.</p>

<p>You can still see my really old <a href="http://searke.blogspot.com/">blog from when I was a teenager</a>. It’s kinda embarrasing but I haven’t taken it down. I also used to have a xanga account as an angsty highschooler. But even I don’t allow myself to read that.</p>
