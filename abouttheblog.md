# About the Blog

I'm using Jekyll as my static site generator and have switched from [bootstrap](http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/) to [pure](http://purecss.io/) for styling.

The blog is being hosted on GitHub. You can see what I've written in Jekyll on my profile.

[MathJax](http://www.mathjax.org) renders the mathematical formula on the blog posts.

The font for the blog is Arvo from Google Fonts.

You can still see my really old <a href="http://searke.blogspot.com/">previous blog</a>. It's kinda embarrasing but I haven't taken it down. I also used to have a xanga account as an angsty highschooler. But even I don't allow myself to read that.
