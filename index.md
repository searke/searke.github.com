## Work

I work for [Wolfram Research](http://www.wolfram.com). See more about my job on [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/sean-clarke/23/918/b5). I enjoy [helping](http://stackoverflow.com/users/426628/searke) [people](http://community.wolfram.com/web/seanc/home?p_p_id=user_WAR_userportlet&p_p_lifecycle=0&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&p_p_col_id=column-1&p_p_col_count=1&tabs1=Discussions) with their scientific computing projects. 

I have a degree in Mathematics and Computer Science from the University of Illinois.

## About the Blog

I'm using Jekyll as my static site generator and have switched from [bootstrap](http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/) to [pure](http://purecss.io/) for styling.

The blog is being hosted on GitHub. You can see what I've written in Jekyll on my profile.

[MathJax](http://www.mathjax.org) renders the mathematical formula on the blog posts.

The font for the blog is Arvo from Google Fonts.

You can still see my really old <a href="http://searke.blogspot.com/">previous blog</a>. It's kinda embarrasing but I haven't taken it down. I also used to have a xanga account as an angsty highschooler. But even I don't allow myself to read that.

## Pronouncing "Searke"
"Searke" was a nickname I was given a long time ago. It's a portmanteau (and hence is very clever) of my first and last name and is pronounced "shark". Here's a graphic of it I made as a teenager that I was inordinately fond of:
