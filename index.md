## Work

I work for [Wolfram Research](http://www.wolfram.com). See more about my job on [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/sean-clarke/23/918/b5). I enjoy [helping] (http://stackoverflow.com/users/426628/searke) [people](http://community.wolfram.com/web/seanc/home?p_p_id=user_WAR_userportlet&p_p_lifecycle=0&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&p_p_col_id=column-1&p_p_col_count=1&tabs1=Discussions) with their scientific computing projects. 

I have a degree in Mathematics and Computer Science from the University of Illinois. 


## More About Me

You can find more things I like and make on [pinterest](http://www.pinterest.com/searke/likes/).

I have a Project Euler account I should probably do more with:

## About the Blog

I'm using Jekyll as my static site generator and have switched from [bootstrap](http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/) to [pure](http://purecss.io/) for styling. I haven't done much with web stuff in a long while except for some minimal wordpress and d3.js.

The blog is being hosted on GitHub. You can see what I've written in Jekyll on my profile.

[MathJax](http://www.mathjax.org) renders the mathematical formula on the blog posts. I'm not exactly happy with the how long it takes to render things, but it seems to be the best solution right now.

The font for the blog is Arvo from Google Fonts.

You can still see my really old <a href="http://searke.blogspot.com/">previous blog</a>. I used to have a xanga account as an angsty teenager as well. You cannot see that becaue it's embarrasing.

## Pronouncing "Searke"
The word searke was a nickname I got a long while ago. It's a portmanteau of my first and last name and is pronounced "shark". Here's a graphic to help you remember:
