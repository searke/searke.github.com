## Work
I work at Wolfram Research in Champaign, Illinois as a technology engineer. Most of my job involves helping researchers with small bits of their scientific programming projects. I actively program in Mathematica and Python to solve a wide variety of problems in scientific computing.

I also write a large amount of documentation whenever possible. I'm fanatical about quality for technical writing. 

I have a degree in Mathematics and Computer Science from the University of Illinois.

## About the Blog

I'm using Jekyll and Twitter Bootstrap to make this blog. It's a small hobby I indulge during some of my spare time over weekends. I haven't done anything with the web in a long time, so I'm probably not using either of the tools correctly yet. 

The blog is being hosted on GitHub. You can see what I've written in Jekyll on my profile.

You can still see my really old <a href="http://searke.blogspot.com/">previous blog</a>. I used to have a xanga account as an angsty teenager as well. You cannot see that.

## Pronouncing "Searke"
The word searke was a nick name I got a long while ago. It's a portmanteau of my first and last name and is pronounced "shark". Here's a graphic to help you remember:
